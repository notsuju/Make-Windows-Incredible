## 🌆Making Windows more Private
This is gonna include setting up a **SECURE DNS**, **HARDENING FIREFOX**, **REMOVING MOST OF THE TELEMETRY** and some more tips.
So lets get started.

### 🪨Installing and hardening firefox
<details close>
<summary>Click me</summary>
<br>

Install firefox from (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
  
#### **You can follow this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr8UFJzpNls&t=490s) for hardening firefox or just follow the following steps.**
  
#### Steps for hardening:
  
1. Changing some basic settings in **settings>home**

> Set homepage and new window to **blank page** (do the same for new tabs)

> Disable: Shortcuts

> Disable: recommended stories

> Disable recent activity

2. Changing settings in **settings>privacy and security**

> Change the tracking protection to Strict

> Enable: Tell websites not to sell or share my data

> Enable: Send websites a “Do Not Track” request

> Go under Firefox Data Collection and Use and disable everything

> Go under HTTPS-Only Mode and Enable: Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows

3. Install extentions

> Ublock origin(for blocking adds)

> Firefox Color(needed later for customizing firefox)

4. Install a user.js file

> [!WARNING]
> **This could break some websites.**

Go to [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) and click on **raw** in the right hand side and copy everything.

HOW TO COPY A RAW FILE [see here](https://github.com/notsuju/Make-Windows-Incredible?tab=readme-ov-file#some-guides-about-how-to-use-github)

**Search** `about:profiles` in the address bar of firefox

Under root directory click `Open Directory` or go to `C:\Users\SUJU\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME` in your file manager

![firefoxopendir](https://github.com/notsuju/Make-Windows-Incredible/assets/131643792/a9318b36-0abd-4675-891f-ec32eff6e2c1)

Create a file called **user.js** in the onpened directory and paste all of the raw file there and save it.
> You can make a file like user.js by changing the `txt` format to `js` see here

![userjss](https://github.com/notsuju/Make-Windows-Incredible/assets/131643792/4cbc0105-5d10-4f47-a6ef-e339f995314d)

5. Changing the search engine to brave (see here [article](https://search.brave.com/default))

> Go to https://search.brave.com/

> Right click on the address bar

> There should be an option to add brave as a searxh engine just click + icon on brave logo

> Now go to firefox settings>search>**Change the search engine to barve**

Now restart firefox and its hardened. Good job!
