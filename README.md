#### Steps for hardening:
  
1. Changing some basic settings in **settings>home**

> Set homepage and new window to **blank page** (do the same for new tabs)

> Disable: Shortcuts

> Disable: recommended stories

> Disable recent activity

2. Changing settings in **settings>privacy and security**

> Change the tracking protection to Strict

> Enable: Tell websites not to sell or share my data

> Enable: Send websites a “Do Not Track” request

> Go under Firefox Data Collection and Use and disable everything

> Go under HTTPS-Only Mode and Enable: Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows

3. Install extentions

> Ublock origin(for blocking adds)

> Firefox Color(needed later for customizing firefox)

4. Install a user.js file

Go to [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) and click on **raw** in the right hand side and copy everything.

**Search** `about:profiles` in the address bar of firefox

Under root directory click `Open Directory` or go to `C:\Users\SUJU\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME` in your file manager

Create a file called **user.js** in the onpened directory and paste all of the raw file there and save it.

Now restart firefox and its hardened. Good job!
